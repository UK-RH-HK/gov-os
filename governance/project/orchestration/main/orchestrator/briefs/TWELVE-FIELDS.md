## The twelve-field return (active since 2026-10-13, DEC-442, DEC-668)

The SubagentStop hook is registered. It refuses (exit 2) the return of any subagent whose last message does not carry all twelve fields of the worker return contract, each as a label at the start of a line, followed by a colon and at least one word:

```
task: <what you were asked to do, in one line>
status: <DONE | PACKAGES | ESCALATION | LEAD_CHECKPOINT | BLOCKED, and one line of why>
work_completed: <what was done>
files_changed: <each path, or "none">
evidence: <commits, logs, command outputs that show it>
tests: <each suite run, with its counts, or "none run">
discoveries: <what you found that was not known, or "none">
risks: <what could go wrong with what was done, or "none">
lessons: <what the next worker should know, or "none">
proposed_decisions: <each package, with your recommendation and confidence, or "none">
unresolved: <what is still open, or "none">
recommended_next_action: <one line>
```

- **Your own last message carries the twelve fields**, in this form, after your summary or as its frame. No field is left empty: write "none" where there is nothing.
- **Every brief you write, for a launched worker or for an in-session subagent, ends with this block word for word and asks for the twelve-field return.** A subagent started through the Agent tool without it will be refused on its return and loop.
- The fields frame the return; they do not shorten it. What the brief asks for in the return (commits with trailers, suite counts, residuals, learning metrics) goes into the matching fields.
