Step 0, before any work: the sandbox check in /home/usain/gov-os-worktrees/W2-37/.gov-runtime/scratch/brief/EMG-d4b-launched.md, reported first in your return (launch_worker.sh).

You are a fresh engineer. Ticket: DAEO-6n5k (W2-37, "gov impact"), profile FULL, class C2. You work only in the worktree `/home/usain/gov-os-worktrees/W2-37` on branch `w2/W2-37`, and write only inside `src/gov/impact/**` and `tests/unit/impact/**` (`src/gov/closure/**` is read API only: do not change its behaviour). The implementation exists and passed its final probe. The owner decided F1 (a) (DEC-1163 (7)), and you build it. An independent test designer writes acceptance cases for the same behaviour in parallel in another worktree; you never read or write `tests/acceptance/`.

## Standing rules
- First: `printenv GOV_ROLE GOV_TICKET` (expect `engineer`, `DAEO-6n5k`); `git rev-parse --show-toplevel --abbrev-ref HEAD` (expect `/home/usain/gov-os-worktrees/W2-37`, `w2/W2-37`); `git rev-parse HEAD` (expect prefix `0c266d752`). If anything differs, stop and say so.
- DEC-732: every test run uses this worktree's own `src/`: `PYTHONPATH=/home/usain/gov-os-worktrees/W2-37/src` per command. Quote `PYTHONPATH=/home/usain/gov-os-worktrees/W2-37/src python3 -c "import gov; print(gov.__file__)"` in your return.
- **Every pytest runs through the heavy slot**, with a TMPDIR outside the repository and outside ~/gov-os-runs (your sandbox's own TMPDIR if `/tmp` is read-only):
  `env TMPDIR=/tmp/gov-os-w237-eng4 PYTHONUSERBASE=/home/usain/.local PATH=/home/usain/.local/bin:/home/usain/.nvm/versions/node/v22.23.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin PYTHONPATH=/home/usain/gov-os-worktrees/W2-37/src bash /home/usain/Dynamic-Agentic-Engineering-OS/.gov-runtime/scratch/orchestrator/tools/heavy_slot.sh python3 -m pytest tests/acceptance/W2-37 tests/unit/impact -q -p no:cacheprovider -o tmp_path_retention_policy=failed -rfs`
  (make the TMPDIR first with `mkdir -p /tmp/gov-os-w237-eng4`). A "all slots taken; waiting" line, or any memory/CPU/disk gate refusal, is a wait, not a refusal. Never `-x`.
- Run everything in the foreground. Return only after your commit exists. No checkout of another commit, reset, clean, stash, amend, rebase, merge, push or tag. Stage by exact path, never `git add -A`/`.`. Untracked sandbox placeholder names (`.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.mcp.json`, ...) are never touched.
- Write files with the Write and Edit tools and literal absolute paths; anything longer than one line of shell goes in a script under `/home/usain/gov-os-worktrees/W2-37/.gov-runtime/scratch/`. No here-documents.
- Never run `gov rebuild`, `gov close`, `gov adopt`, `gov pause`, `gov retrieve` or `gov context`. Search with Read and Grep; search again once in different words if the first does not answer. A code question uses the code graph's traversal, never a whole-graph query (DEC-859).
- Never read `.claude/settings*.json`, anything under `~/.claude/`, the held-out file under `governance/project/`, the evaluation sets' root, or any hidden or memory-verdict folder. No glob/search/listing over `governance/project/`.
- Refused twice for the same call by the guard, the sandbox or a hook: stop and say so. Never work around a refusal. Install nothing.

## What to make true (with unit tests in `tests/unit/impact/`)
**F1 (a), DEC-1163 (7); the ticket's S2 Verify clause:** G-24's "no record names the item" counts the store's stated links too — a ticket's `sources` and `closes`, and the register's Under and Changes (supersession/amendment) lines. A decision named only through them is not deletable: "a planted decision named only by a ticket's sources is not deletable".

Where things are:
- `src/gov/impact/__init__.py`: `_Records` (around line 71) builds `self.named_by` from the store's edges only; `assess` (around line 290) reads `named = bool(graph.named_by.get(item))` into `readings.deletable` (reading R8, `src/gov/impact/readings.py` around line 39).
- The store keeps the links the records state that no edge holds in its `stated_links` table (`src/gov/store/loader.py`: module docstring, `LINKS_TABLE`, `_stated_links` around line 436; types CITES for `CITE_KEYS` such as `sources`/`closes`, OF_TASK, SUPERSEDES/AMENDS/UNDER for the register's statements). `src/gov/retrieval/graph_route.py::stated_links(root)` is an existing reader of it (returns None where the store holds no such table) — reuse it or read the table the same way.

Make the deletable join count a stated link's source as naming its target (any of the stated link types; what the item itself names does not count, as today). Update reading R8's comment to say so (F1 (a), DEC-1163). Where the store holds no `stated_links` table (an older store), do not read the item as unnamed: either treat the record graph as not current for the deletable reading or add a gap, so the stricter side holds (a graph not read in full never makes an item deletable). Decide whether stated links also belong in the walk that lists `affected` items and the one-hop radius; keep it minimal: if adding them there changes any green acceptance case, do not, and say so in `discoveries`. Unit tests: a decision named only by a ticket's `sources:` is not deletable; only by `closes:`; only by a register `**Under:**` line; a decision no edge and no stated link names stays deletable on a current graph.

Keep the change small; no behaviour that is green today changes. At the end, the acceptance suite run above: every case that passed before still passes; the two `test_w2_37_skill_routing.py::test_the_skill_runs_gov_impact_for_the_question` cases stay red (the change skill is another worker's: name them, do not touch them). Cases that build a code index may error at setup inside the sandbox (`/tmp/gov-cbm-<uid>` read-only): name them, the lead runs them outside.

## Commit (one commit, your paths only)
    git commit -m "W2-37: gov impact, G-24 counts the store's stated links (F1 (a), DEC-1163)" --trailer "Task: DAEO-6n5k" --trailer "Role: engineer" --trailer "Implements: CAP-33.b, CAP-33.g, DEC-167" -- src/gov/impact tests/unit/impact
Then show `git log -1 --format='%H%n%B'` and `git status --short`.

## Return (your last message; the twelve fields as labelled lines, "none" where nothing)
task: / status: / work_completed: / files_changed: / evidence: / tests: / discoveries: / risks: / lessons: / proposed_decisions: / unresolved: / recommended_next_action:
In `tests:` give the suite's counts and each red with its reason. Then `guard_refusals:` (none, or each refusal's command form and reason).
